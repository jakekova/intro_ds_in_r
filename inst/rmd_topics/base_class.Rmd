```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
```


## Description

The `class()` function comes with R and is part of the Base R `{base}` package.
  
We use this function to determine what _type_ of value an object or value is, i.e. is the value a numeric, logical, character, etc.

## Conceptual usage 

```{r usage, eval=FALSE}
class(variable or value of interest)
```

## Examples


```{r example1}
# Find the type of the value 5
class(5)
```

<br>

```{r example2}
# Find the type of the value 'this is a string'
class('this is a string')
```

<br>

```{r example3}
# Find the type of a previously defined variable
x <- 75.5
class(x)
```
