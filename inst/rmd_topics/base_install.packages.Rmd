```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,

                      message = FALSE)
```


## Description

The `install.packages()` function comes with R and is part of the Base R `{base}` package.
  
We use this function to install packages, aka libraries, onto your computer. Libraries only need to be installed one time. To _load_ an installed library, use the function `library()`. 

If you need to install a package from a non-default database (i.e. not CRAN), this function may or may not work.



## Conceptual usage 

```{r usage, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("name of package to install in quotes")

install.packages(c("array", "of", "package", "names", "to", "install"))
```

## Examples


```{r example1, eval = FALSE}
# Install the viridis package
install.packages("viridis")
```
