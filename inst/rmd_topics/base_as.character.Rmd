```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
```


## Description

The `as.character()` function comes with R and is part of the Base R `{base}` package.
  
We use this function to _coerce_ a value or variable to be a character, i.e. change the variable's type into a character type. 



## Conceptual usage 

```{r usage, eval=FALSE}
as.character(value to coerce into character type)
```

## Examples


```{r example1}
# Convert the number 10 into character "10"
as.character(10)
```

<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->

```{r example2}
# Convert the logical value `TRUE` (no quotes!) into a character type  
# containing the literal letters (in quotes!) "TRUE".
as.character(TRUE)
```
